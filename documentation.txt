NAME
    codepad

FUNCTIONS
    call(c)
        Execute an ANSI escape code
    
    clear()
        Clear the screen.
    
    color(x)
        Set the foreground text color (FG) or the cell background color (BG).
        
        Parameters are added together. Ex:
        color(fg+red+brite)
        color(bg+blue)
        color(reset)
        
        `brite` serves to expose a lighter version of the original palette, allowing for
        16 colors total.
        
        In general the following sums are acceptable:
        SCOLOR+MODE+brite
        COLOR+MODE
        reset
        
        where COLOR is black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, or reset
        SCOLOR stands for Strict Color, it is the same as COLOR except it excludes reset
        MODE is either fg or bg
        
        As a special case reset can be called without a MODE, in which case it will reset
        both the fg and the bg. And of course reset cannot be brightened.
    
    cursor(x, y, delta=False)
    
    nl()
        Reset color and write newline.
    
    pix(x, y, c)
        Shorthand for cursor(x,y); color(bg+c); write(" ")
    
    place(x, y, s)
        Puts a string on screen with some special features.
        
        (1) Parts of the string that go past the screen boundary are clipped
        (2) Newlines stay on the same column without overwritting preceeding content
        (3) Character \0 can be used as a transparent value
    
    ploop()
        Place this in the condition of the main loop.
        Ex:
        while ploop():
            write("Prompt value: " + promptValue + " " + frameNumber + "\n:")
        
        It will provide one prompt per frame and leave the collected input in a variable
        called promptValue.
    
    prompt()
        Get the prompt input that came before this frame.
    
    size()
    
    write(c)
        Write character to cursor location
